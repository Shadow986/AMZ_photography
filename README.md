Project Structure

üñ•Ô∏è Frontend
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Hosting: Vercel
The frontend is a responsive web interface that allows users to view and purchase photography services. It is built using:

HTML: for structure
CSS: for styling
JavaScript: for interactivity
The frontend is deployed and hosted on Vercel, ensuring fast and reliable access for users.

‚òÅÔ∏è Backend
Technologies: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB
Services: AWS S3
Framework: Serverless Framework
The backend is fully serverless, with the following components:

AWS Lambda: Handles application logic (e.g., user sessions, service requests)
API Gateway: Acts as the entry point for the frontend to communicate with backend services
DynamoDB: Stores user data and service information
AWS S3: Used for static asset storage
üîó Frontend and Backend Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs managed by AWS API Gateway. These APIs are consumed in the JavaScript code, allowing users to:

Book photography sessions
View available packages

üöÄ Deployment Instructions
Frontend
Clone the frontend repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/MarcieD1/amz-photography-frontend.git
cd amz-photography-frontend

Deploy the project:
bash
Copy code
vercel
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the deployment.

Backend
Set up the Serverless Framework:
Install the Serverless Framework:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g serverless
Deploy the backend:
bash
Copy code
serverless deploy
This will create the necessary AWS resources and deploy the Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB tables.

üõ†Ô∏è Challenges Encountered
Integration Issues: Initial difficulties in integrating the Vercel-hosted frontend with the AWS-hosted backend. Resolved by configuring CORS settings in API Gateway.
Serverless Deployment: Understanding the Serverless Framework and setting up AWS permissions was challenging but resolved with thorough documentation and practice.

üéì Lessons Learned
Serverless Architecture: Gained hands-on experience with AWS Serverless technologies, facilitating scalable and manageable backend services.
Frontend-Backend Integration: Learned how to effectively connect a modern frontend with a serverless backend, emphasizing API design and deployment strategies.

üöß Future Improvements
Enhanced Authentication: Consider implementing AWS Cognito for a more robust authentication system.
Caching Strategy: Implement more efficient caching with CloudFront to reduce latency and improve load times.

ÔøΩÔøΩ Conclusion
AMZ Photography is a robust and scalable platform combining modern frontend technologies with powerful serverless backend services. The project is designed for easy extensibility, allowing for future enhancements.
